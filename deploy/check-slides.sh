#!/usr/bin/env bash
# check-slides.sh [DECK.md …] — render a Marp presentation and check every
# slide fits its 16:9 frame (#77). Default deck: docs/presentation.md.
#
#   sc-build deploy/check-slides.sh
#   sc-build 'deploy/check-slides.sh docs/presentation.md'
#
# The build box has no browser installed for the build user, and under
# "nothing kept" (owner, 2026-09-28) none is (#77). So, like deploy/test.sh,
# this installs Playwright's headless chromium into the job's own scratch
# directory (deleted afterwards) and points Marp at it with CHROME_PATH — then
# marp-cli can render `--pdf` / `--images png`, which fail with "No suitable
# browser found" without one. Liberation fonts (metric-compatible with Arial)
# are already on the Fedora build box, so the measured fit is accurate; if a
# future box lacks them the fit is approximate and that is said.
#
# For each deck it renders the HTML (template `bare`, every slide visible) and
# the per-slide PNGs, then deploy/slide-fit.mjs measures each slide's content
# height against the 720 px frame and fails if any overflows (sc#15: 9 of 12
# slides ran past the frame and nobody had seen it, because nothing could
# render it). Run it when a deck changes; every component can do the same with
# a copy of these two files.
